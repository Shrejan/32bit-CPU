# 🖥️ 32-Bit CPU Architecture in Logisim

![Project Banner](images/cpu-banner.png)

A **fully modular 32-bit CPU design** built using **Logisim**, demonstrating how a processor works internally using fundamental computer architecture components such as:

* Program Counter
* Register File
* Control Unit
* Memory-Mapped I/O
* ALU
* Instruction Flow System

This project is designed for **students, beginners, and hardware enthusiasts** who want to explore CPU design at the circuit level.

# ⚙️ Instruction Cycle (How the CPU Works)

The CPU executes instructions in the following stages:

1 Fetch
Program Counter selects the next instruction.

2 Decode
Control Unit interprets the instruction.

3 Execute
ALU performs operations.

4 Memory Access
Reads or writes data.

5 Write Back
Result stored into registers or output.
